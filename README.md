# Start-up-landing-page-
Mock up of a human-kitten landing page design to let the user sign up for their perfect kitten adoption match. 


==Description==
This landing page serves as a mock-up. The main features is the navigation bar, the use of jQuery for the menu icon to be responsive. Additionally, I used Google font "Lato" and also customized my landing page with a background from unsplash and use of buttons from bootstrap. Just a cute little idea of a website that would serve as a service to help Humans and kittens find the perfect match for each other during the intial phase of adoption.
